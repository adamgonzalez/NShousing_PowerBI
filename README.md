# NShousing_PowerBI
A Power BI dashboard presenting key trends of real estate sales in Nova Scotia from 2015-2025. 

## Data
The data have been acquired through datazONE and have been pre-processed (cleaned, filtered, combined, etc.) using SQL before being loaded into Power BI.

## Dashboard
The dashboard presents a table of number of sales, median sale price in 2015 and 2025, and increase of median sale price between 2015 and 2025 by county on the left side. 

Users are able to adjust for different price and date ranges using the selection boxes along the centre top. 

On the top right, a colour-coded county map is displayed. In the centre, the total sales volume and peak sales year as well as total sales value and peak price increase year are displayed. 

Along the bottom right are four plots displaying the sales volume and year-over-year changes as well as the median sale price and year-over-year changes by year.

Prior to county selection, the information boxes and plots will be blank. Once a county, or multiple counties, are selected, the corresponding information will appear.

An animated GIF showcasing the dashboard features is shown below.
